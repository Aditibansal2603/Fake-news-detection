## Problem Statement
In recent years, misinformation and disinformation campaigns have become increasingly prevalent around the world.<br>

Disinformation campaigns are a new form of asymmetrical information warfare, in which a coordinated effort is made to manipulate public manipulations.<br>
According to the U.S. Department of State, "the top one percent of fake news stories typically reached between 1,000 and 100,000 people, whereas true stories rarely exceeded an audience of one thousand."

## Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning problem
Predict whether an article is fake news or not on the input parameters like title, author and text.<br>
<b>Type</b> : Supervised Learning<br>
<b>Task</b> : Binary classification<br>
<b>Performance metric</b>  Accuracy<br>

## About Dataset
